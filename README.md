# How it works

The player is provided of 16 cards on the table (8 couples of 2 identic cards). The goal of the game is to match all couples.
1. The game starts with all cards facing up for a second then it will flip down. 
2. then the timer starts when the page is loaded.
3. Click a card to flip it. Only two cards can be flipped in a move. If the two cards match they will permanently face up. 
4. If cards do not match, be sure to remember the card locations. The cards flip quickly after the second card is clicked, so be aware.
5. The aim of the game is to get the highest streak.
6. The game will end when all cards face up Or the time is out. 
7. You can then choose to play again or exit the game.
